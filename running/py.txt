Take note of what version of python your script is made in/for 

Python scripts are run with one of the following: 


cmd/ps > python %DRIVE%:\path\to\script.py 
cmd/ps > python path\to\script.py 
cmd/ps > python[insert version number] %DRIVE%:\path\to\script.py 
cmd/ps > python[insert version number] path\to\script.py 
cmd/ps > %DRIVE%:\path\to\python[insert version number].exe %DRIVE%:\path\to\script.py 
cmd/ps > %DRIVE%:\path\to\python[insert version number].exe path\to\script.py 

sh/bash/zsh > python path/to/script.py 
sh/bash/zsh > python[insert version number] path/to/script.py 
sh/bash/zsh > path/to/python[insert version number] path/to/script.py 


Which one to use depends on: 
- the default python version of your system 
- what python binaries are registered in your system's %PATH% 
- where the script.py is located relative to your terminal 
- if you're using Linux or Windows (or other relevant OSes, eg. MacOS.) 

NB!: Since Linux' paths are only absolute if they're prefaced with '/', there is little difference in whether it is or not, so i dont include this difference in my list.
