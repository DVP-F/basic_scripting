Use 'crontab -e' to edit cron tasks 

Write tasks as such: 
minute - hour - day-of-month - month - day-of-week - command 
m h  dom mon dow   command 
0 0 0 0 0 ping localhost:2360 -c 3 
@reboot xfce-terminal top 

use https://crontab.guru/ for help with generating 
usable input for timing and its meaning: 
* any time 
, list separator 
- range of values 
/ step values 
@yearly 
@annually 
@monthly 
@weekly 
@daily 
@hourly 
@reboot 

NB: @ times are non-standard and not guaranteed to work. 

Enable cron as a service with either: 
sudo > systemctl enable cron 
sudo > service cron enable 

Check which is correct at https://linuxhandbook.com/start-stop-restart-cron/ 
- or refer to: 


For Redhat/CentOS: 
service crond enable 

On older versions of Redhat and Centos, use: 
/etc/init.d/crond enable 

For Ubuntu and Debian Systems: 
sudo service cron enable 

On older versions, you can use the following: 
sudo /etc/init.d/cron enable
