Check example.service for basic structure of .service files. 

Service files should be placed in /etc/systemd/system/ 

The most important thing in the file is ExecStart - this contains the command to run your script. 

The example file, like most services, is configured to run at boot 


To enable your newly-created service, run the following commands: 

> sudo systemctl daemon-reload                    // makes systemctl aware of your service file 
> sudo systemctl enable <service name>.service    // <service name> is the name of the .service file. 
> sudo systemctl is-enabled <service name>.service 

is-enabled returns if the service is enabled or not. You can also check the status of the service with 

> sudo systemctl status <service name>.service 

Technically you can do without the .service appendum, but its better practice to use it. 


This assumed that you have sudo. In the case you do not, or want to configure a service for a regular user, one that doesnt need su privileges, you can do this instead: 

> mkdir ~/.config/systemd/user 

Make a file in this directory with the same structure as example2.service 

> systemctl --user daemon-reload 
> systemctl --user enable <service name>.service 
> systemctl --user is-enabled <service name>.service 

Again, an alternative to check the status of the service is: 

> systemctl --user status <service name>.service
