Make a .sh script executable for the current user by running 

>> chmod +x <file>

then either run graphically, or from terminal with:

./<file>
or
sh ./<file>
or
bash ./<file>
or 
zsh ./<file>

most likely you want sh or bash. 

Technically the './' isnt always needed but for the sake of ease-of-use and to guarantee itll work. its better to use than not.
