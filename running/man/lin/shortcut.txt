NB!: read through full procedure before committing. There are some flaws and downsides you have to balance to your needs. 

Adding a shortcut to your "Start menu" or whiskermenu can go one of two ways; 

1. Installing a menu manager 
2. Creating a .desktop file 

Using a menu manager: 

For this, ill use MenuLibre, and installing it on a Debian-based distro (Kali) 

Download the most recent compatible .deb package at https://packages.debian.org/sid/all/menulibre/download
Direct link to NORWEGIAN dl server (2.2.2-2): http://ftp.no.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/menulibre/menulibre_2.2.2-2_all.deb 

In a terminal cd'd to your download directory: 
> sudo dpkg -i menulibre_2.2.2-2_all.deb   // or whichever other version you have, use tab to auto-complete 'menulibre' 

or without cd'ing 
> sudo dpkg -i path/to/menulibre_2.2.2-2_all.deb    // yk what im gonna say here 

If any dependency is missing, youll have to download a .deb package for that and install it the same way, before installing MenuLibre. 

Launching MenuLibre from a terminal: 
> menulibre 

Launching from whiskermenu: 
Search for 'Menu Editor' 

! Depending on, this may have emptied your current whiskermenu, so you'll have to recreate it. 

MenuLibre is very simple to use, so a little bit of exploring and/or searching up how to use it properly will be all you need to fully customize your menu. 


Using a .desktop file: 

The exact procedure here will likely depend heavily on your distro. I will show how to do it on Kali, and probably most other Debian-based distros. 

In your file manager or terminal, navigate to: 
/usr/share/applications

Alternatively you can search for the correct location with '.desktop' in your file manager. (Make sure to search in 'File System')

Create a file however you'd like (eg. nano, gedit, vim, etc.) 
With the following name: <app name>.desktop (either on creation or edit name to this.) 
If possible, avoid spaces in the name. 

Now write the following in this file: 
[Desktop Entry] 
Type=Application 
Terminal=true                         // or false, if it should open a terminal to run in or not. 
Exec=<the command to run your app>    // should be something like 'sh ./home/%USER%/app.sh' or 'python /etc/script.py' 
Name=<app name> 

Optionally add: 
GenericName=<what type of app it is> 
Comment=<explanation of what your app is/does> 

Check the example file example.desktop for well, an example. 

! This is not guaranteed to work. It most likely will, but i can make no guarantees for this one.
