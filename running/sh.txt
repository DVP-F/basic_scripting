Make a .sh script executable for the current user by running 

>> chmod +x <file>

then either run graphically, or from terminal with:

./<file>
or
sh ./<file>
or
bash ./<file>
or 
zsh ./<file>

most likely you want sh or bash. 

Technically the './' isnt always needed but for the sake of ease-of-use and to guarantee itll work, its better to use than not. 


Linux CANNOT run a script properly if the line endings are CRLF - they have to be LF. 
    The difference is:
    CRLF: \r\n  [Carriage-return][Line-feed]
    LF:   \n    [Line-feed]
So when making a script, either make it on a linux system - you dont need to consider it then because itll be handled automatically - or make sure to set the line ending setting to LF for Linux, CRLF for Windows, and CR for Macintosh.
