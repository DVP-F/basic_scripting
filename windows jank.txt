Kernel (MS DOS) 
-> cmd 
    == .bat, .cmd 
        -- cls, ping, echo 

OS (Windows 10/11) 
-> Powershell
    == .ps1
        -- Get-TPM, clear, Set-TimeZone, etc. 

A Command prompt (cmd.exe) is limited to what the MS-DOS kernel has available of commands. 
A Powershell (ISE or not) can do both OS level commands and call Kernel level commands -- although the latter isnt stable, guaranteed, or advised. 


To avoid these limitations, call the app itself as such: 

powershell -command "get-timezone" 
cmd.exe [/S /C|/K] "<command>" 

Note that this will start a process as a child of itself, which will take more resources than otherwise. 
In the case of batch, use of the 'start' command will launch the given application in a different process, no longer a child of the routine that called it. 
-- use this to run commands in parallell. See bat/para.bat
